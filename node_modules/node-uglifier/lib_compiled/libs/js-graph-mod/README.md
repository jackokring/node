`js-graph` is a javascript library for storing arbitrary data in mathematical (di)graphs,
as well as traversing and analyzing them in various ways. It was originally created to
track dependencies between options and modules.

The library is fully functional and has near 100% test-coverage, but the API is not yet
properly documented. You could, of course, read the tests in the `spec` directory, but
user-friendly API documentation is forthcoming.

Feedback of any kind (questions, issues, pull requests) is greatly appreciated.
